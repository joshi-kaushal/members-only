# members-only

_Member's only_ is a small private club in which people can discuss about their day to day happenings and tell each other about their life.

> The application is a club with three levels of users: guests, members and admins.

Everyone who can see the club from the outside can read threads posted in the club.  
But to know the author, or post a new thread, the person must become a member themselves.

By becoming a **member**, user gets privilege to post a new thread and see everyone else's posts. The user can also delete their own posts if they want.
